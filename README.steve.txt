Pouch Transport for ElFinder

This version of elFinder has been hacked to allow pouchdb based file systems so that I can take advantage of the automatic and live synchronisation features.
In so far as possible the implementation is strictly as a transport layer so that I maintain compatibility with ftp and mysql and www local filesystems.
